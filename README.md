# leaflet.js-simple-example

## a simple example of the basics of leaflet.js

In this example I've wrapped up in the javascript object MapManager some basics function that will let you initialize a map,
create baselayers, create WMS overlays, add custom markers and manage a menu for the user to choose base layer and overlays.
